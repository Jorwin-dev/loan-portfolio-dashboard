# loan-portfolio-dashboard
A data analysis project using **SQL, Tableau, and Excel** to track loan performance and borrower risk.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bank loan data using **SQL** for data cleaning and transformations, followed by **Tableau** for interactive visualizations.

## Files in This Repository
- `bank_loan_analysis.sql` - SQL queries for data cleaning and transformation.
- `cleaned_bank_loan_data.csv` - Final cleaned dataset used for Tableau analysis.
- `loan_dashboard.twbx` - Packaged Tableau workbook containing interactive reports.

## SQL Work Done
✔ Removed **NULL values** and fixed inconsistencies  
✔ Aggregated **KPI metrics** (Loan Applications, Funded Amounts, Bad Loan %)  
✔ Created **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Previous Month-to-Date (PMTD)** comparisons  
✔ Segmented **loan status by borrower risk**  

## Tableau Dashboard Features
- **Loan Summary:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) including total loans, funded amounts, and borrower risk levels.
- **Loan Trends Overview:** Monthly trends, loan applications by purpose, and regional loan distribution.
- **Detailed Loan Data:** Interactive breakdown of individual loans by status, amount, and borrower characteristics.

## How to Use
1. Open `bank_loan_analysis.sql` in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Execute the queries on the `bank_loan_data` table.
3. Use `cleaned_bank_loan_data.csv` in **Tableau Public** to recreate the visualizations.
4. Open `loan_dashboard.twbx` to explore the **interactive dashboards**.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** - Data cleaning & transformation  
- **Tableau Public** - Data visualization & reporting  
- **Excel** - Data exploration & validation  
- **GitHub** - Version control & documentation
